  abstract  = {Style transfer has been well studied in recent years with excellent performance processed. While existing methods usually choose CNNs as the powerful tool to accomplish superb stylization, less attention was paid to the latent style space. Rare exploration of underlying dimensions results in the poor style controllability and the limited practical application. In this work, we rethink the internal meaning of style features, further proposing a novel unsupervised algorithm for style discovery and achieving personalized manipulation. In particular, we take a closer look into the mechanism of style transfer and obtain different artistic style components from the latent space consisting of different style features. Then fresh styles can be generated by linear combination according to various style components. Experimental results have shown that our approach is superb in 1) restylizing the original output with the diverse artistic styles discovered from the latent space while keeping the content unchanged, and 2) being generic and compatible for various style transfer methods.},

  abstract  = {The generation of smooth and continuous images between domains has recently drawn much attention in image-to-image (I2I) translation. Linear relationship acts as the basic assumption in most existing approaches, while applied to different aspects including features, models or labels. However, the linear interpolation will sacrifice the magnitude when adding two vectors subject to the sum weights equals to 1 (illustrated in Fig.3). In this paper, we propose a novel rotation-oriented solution and model the continuous generation with an in-plane rotation over the style representation of an image, achieving a network named RoNet. A rotation module is implanted in the generation network to automatically learn the proper plane while disentangling the content and the style of an image. To encourage realistic texture, we also design a patch-based semantic style loss that learns the different styles of the similar object in different domains. We conduct experiments on forest scenes (where the complex texture makes the generation very challenging), faces, streetscapes and the iphone2dslr task. The results validate the superiority of our method in terms of visual quality and continuity.}

  abstract  = {With the rise of neural networks, many deep hashing networks have been successfully trained on the basis of large-scale data. However, the conventional learning process has received increasing challenges from the data privacy concerns and the decentralized storage status, especially in sensitive scenarios like surveillance retrieval. Further considering the probable different distributions of the decentralized data, in this paper, we present a collaborative hashing paradigm FedA-Hash (Federating Adapted Hashing nets) to produce personalized hashing models for the participants without exchanging their local data. To this end, the bilateral knowledge is blended gradually during the learning process between the aggregated global model and the local hashing model, instead of replacing the local model with the global model directly. Extensive experiments are conducted on representative hashing networks, involving tasks as image retrieval and person re-identification. The results show that FedA-Hash significantly enables the collaborated performance among different clients.},

  abstract  = {Due to the limitation of spatial receptive field, it is challenging for CNN-based style transfer methods to capture rich and long-range semantic concepts in artworks. Though the transformer provides a fresh solution by considering long-range dependencies, it suffers from the heavy burdens of parameter scale and computation cost especially in vision tasks. In this paper, we design a compact transformer architecture AdaFormer to address the problem. The model scale shrinks about 20% compared to state-of-the-art transformer for style transfer. Furthermore, we explore the adaptive style transfer by letting the content to select the detailed style element automatically and adaptively, which encourages the output to be both appealing and reasonable. We evaluate AdaFormer comprehensively in the experiments and the results have shown the effectiveness and superiority of our approach compared to existing artistic methods. Diverse plausible stylized images are obtained with better content preservation, more convincing style sfumato and lower computation complexity.},
