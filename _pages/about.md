Hello! My name is Xin Xie. 

I am a second-year master candidate at [School of Information and Communication Engineering](https://ee.dlut.edu.cn/), [Dalian university of technology (DLUT, 985)](https://en.dlut.edu.cn/), advised by Associate Prof. [Yi Li](http://faculty.dlut.edu.cn/liyi/zh_CN/index/1090895/list/index.htm). Before that, I obtained my B.E. degree (GPA: 4.01/5.0, Rank: 7) in Automation from [Dalian Maritime University (DLMU, 211)](http://english.dlmu.edu.cn/).

My research interest lies in machine learning on image generation. I currently focus on feature disentanglement on image-to-image translation and artisitc style transfer.
