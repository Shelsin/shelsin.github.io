Hello! My name is Xin Xie (Chinese name: 谢鑫). 

I am a first-year PhD candidate at [UNSW](https://www.unsw.edu.au/), advised by [Dong Gong](https://donggong1.github.io/). I obtained the master degree at [School of Information and Communication Engineering](https://ee.dlut.edu.cn/), [Dalian university of technology (DLUT, 985)](https://en.dlut.edu.cn/), advised by Associate Prof. [Yi Li](http://faculty.dlut.edu.cn/liyi/en/index.htm).

My research interest lies in machine learning on image generation. I currently focus on feature disentanglement on image-to-image translation and artisitc style transfer.
