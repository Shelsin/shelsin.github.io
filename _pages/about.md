Hello! My name is Xin Xie (Chinese name: 谢鑫). 

I am a third-year (final-year) master candidate at [School of Information and Communication Engineering](https://ee.dlut.edu.cn/), [Dalian university of technology (DLUT, 985)](https://en.dlut.edu.cn/), advised by Associate Prof. [Yi Li](http://faculty.dlut.edu.cn/liyi/en/index.htm). Before that, I obtained my B.E. degree (GPA: 4.00/5.0, Rank: 7/123) in Automation from [Dalian Maritime University (DLMU, 211)](http://english.dlmu.edu.cn/).

My research interest lies in machine learning on image generation. I currently focus on feature disentanglement on image-to-image translation and artisitc style transfer.

My email: shelsin.ckg [AT] gmail.com or shelsin [AT] mail.dlut.edu.cn

Note：I am looking for Phd program. Please be free to reach out if there are any suitable positions. I am self-motivated and have a passion for doing research. Thank you!
